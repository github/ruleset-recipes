# Ruleset recipes
Starter rulesets are pre-baked to make it easy to get started with [repository rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).

## What is a ruleset?

A ruleset is a named list of rules that applies to a repository. You can create rulesets to control how people interact with selected branches and tags in a repository. You can control things like who can push commits to a particular branch or who can delete or rename a tag. For example, you could set up a ruleset for your repository's feature branch that requires signed commits and blocks force pushes for all users except repository administrators.
